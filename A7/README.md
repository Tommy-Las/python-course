This program was really helpful since it helped me understand how classes work and how to implement them. I was able to overload the + and - operator. Also I implemented a class function, which can only be accessed by the class. This function was used to check whether rgb values were from a predefined color. At first I was going to implement it outside the class, but I realized that it was going to be used when overloading + - operators, so I needed a function inside the class.

For future improvements, I would maybe improve error handling, for example, if the user enters more than 4 numbers.
